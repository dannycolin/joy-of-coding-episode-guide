  - As a normal user: What other products of Mozilla (e.g. Pocket, Mozilla VPN, Firefox Relay, Thunderbird) do you use on a daily basis? What are the features of Firefox you can't live without (e.g. Containers, Picture-in-Picture etc.)?

    - Have used Relay in the past, but don't often create aliases
    - Lockwise
  - Can you describe your day of work? (eg. do you have special time to read emails, bugzilla, catch up with slack/matrix, etc.) - what changes when you work on a bigger project vs during a normal day?
    - Every day is different, because (at least at this point in my career), I get roped into lots of different meetings.
    - Try to have concentrated blocks of working time
    - The first thing I do in the morning, is go through what happened since the last time I was around.
    - Look at my calendar for the day, look at my task list, and then try to plan a route

    - Dishwasher
    - Music store clerk, guitar lesson teacher
    - Quality assurance clerk at a salvage firm
    - Greenhouse, lifting, moving, planting, watering, pruning, etc.
    - Gardener
    - Web application developer for a school board
    - TA
