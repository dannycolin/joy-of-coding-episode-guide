- Questions:
    - You're usually working on the [Rapid Release](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar) of Firefox. If you write an important patch for a bug which is also applicable to Firefox ESR (with a much higher demand of stability), how does Mozilla decide which of these patches will land in the usually much older codebase?

- Deserialize - "turn a serialized object back into the complex object”
