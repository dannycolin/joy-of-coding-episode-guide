**Today**

* Questions:
	* Just a reminder: I saw in the release note  of 120.0.1 that the status bar bug you mentioned in ep 347 has been resolved. Congrats.
	* Not a technical question. Just curious about Mozilla career. 
	    * 1) If you're a regular Firefox contributor/volunteer and an employee invited you to join the team,  will the interview process differ with applying online directly?  (For example, is taking an online coding challenge necessary for this kind of interview?)
	    * 2) What will you ask as an interviewer or What makes you think the interviewer is qualified?
- Windows Jump List update
	- It's on by default on Nightly! \o/

- Let's try to get rid of the favicon hangs instead
