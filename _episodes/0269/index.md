## Topics
* Starting to post to [JoC](https://mikeconley.ca/joc/) instead of :
  - Posting to [/r/WatchPeopleCode](https://reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleCode) and crosspost to [/r/firefox](https://reddit.com/r/firefox)
  - Because Reddit has recently expressed that they're going to compute link karma (Reddit karma) using blockchain technology.
* Congratulations shirshak55 on your first patch for [Bug 1707279](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1707279)

* Question time! FINALLY answering :
  - WebExtensions and how they interact with [DocShells](https://mikeconley.ca/blog/?s=docshell) / BrowsingContexts
    - [Reading up on DocShells](https://mikeconley.ca/blog/?s=docshell)
    - [A stream](https://mzl.la/joy-of-coding-2021-09-29) where i talked about DocShells and BrowsingContext
    - nsISupports.QueryInterface vs nsIInterfaceRequestor.getInterface
    - QueryInterface ~= dynamic cast. "If you implement this interface, then expose these methods / properties / attributes to me"
    - GetInterface: "Get me something that implements a particular interface that is relevant to you, but is not necessarily you"
