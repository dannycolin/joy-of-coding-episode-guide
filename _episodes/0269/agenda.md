    - /r/WatchPeopleCode, crosspost to /r/firefox/
    - Reddit has recently expressed that they're going to compute link karma (Reddit karma) using blockchain technology.
- Congratulations shirshak55 on your patch for [this bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1707279)!
- Code review: https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D129326

        - [Reading up on DocShells](https://mikeconley.ca/blog/?s=docshell)
        - [A stream where I talked about DocShells and BrowsingContexts](https://mzl.la/joy-of-coding-2021-09-29)
        - nsISupports.QueryInterface vs nsIInterfaceRequestor.getInterface
            
            QueryInterface ~= dynamic cast. "If you implement this interface, then expose these methods / properties / attributes to me"
            
            GetInterface: "Get me something that implements a particular interface that is relevant to you, but is not necessarily you"
