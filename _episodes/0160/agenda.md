**Glossary**

- BHR - “Background Hang Reporter”, a thing that records information about when Firefox performs poorly and sends it over Telemetry
- e10s ("ee ten ESS") - short for [Electrolysis, which is the multi-process Firefox project](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis)
- CPOW ("ka-POW" or sometimes "SEE-pow") = Cross-Process Object Wrapper. [See this blog post.](http://mikeconley.ca/blog/2015/02/17/on-unsafe-cpow-usage-in-firefox-desktop-and-why-is-my-nightly-so-sluggish-with-e10s-enabled/)
- Deserialize - "turn a serialized object back into the complex object”
- Serialize - "turn a complex object into something that can be represented as primitives, like strings, integers, etc
- Regression - something that made behaviour worse rather than better. Regress means to “go backward”, more or less.
