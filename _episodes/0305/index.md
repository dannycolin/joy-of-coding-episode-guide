## Topics
* Back in the office, so WindowsJumpList on pause this week. Back next week!
* Let's quickly put the chat on the website.
* Mastodon!
  - Has _some_ superficial similarities to Twitter, the structure of it and how it's organized is closer to something like e-mail, the telephone system, and/or Matrix
    - ActivityPub is a protocol
  - It is an application that one deploys. There areÂ instances of Mastodon rather than a monolithic single instance
  - Mastodon is to ActivityPub as GMail is to email, except that Mastodon is open-source and you can host your own instance if you'd like
    - "Federation", and the set of federated systems that talk to each other form a network that are colloquially known as the "fediverse"
  - Diaspora*, for example, can communicate with other "pods"
  - PixelFed speaks ActivityPub
  - Pleroma speaks ActivityPub
  - PeerTube speaks ActivityPub (diode.zone is what I use)
* Unified Extensions panel work!
  - Rebase and land reviewed patch
  - Review patch
  - <b>Do other work</b>
