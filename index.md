## The Joy of Coding: Episode Guide

The Joy of Coding is a livehacking stream that I do weekly on Wednesday's at 1PM ET.

You can find all of the past episodes here on [Air Mozilla](https://air.mozilla.org/) and search for Joy of Coding or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmaFLMwlbk8wKMvfEEzp9Hfdlid8VYpL5).

One of my viewers had the brilliant idea of making it possible to have an episode guide to accompany and complement the "agenda" that I normally lay out beforehand. This is very similar to how [handmadehero.org](https://handmadehero.org)'s [episode guide](https://hero.handmade.network/episodes) works.

So that's what this is! Still early days, but hopefully we can make this thing work properly. Or it'll fail miserably, who knows? No plan survives breakfast.

## Planned Structure

Each episode should have its own directory, like `episode-0001`. If I ever get over 9999 episodes, I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

We should have an index page that lists links to each episodes guide, which naturally are all contained within their folders.

Each guide should link to the various streams that exist for that particular episode. I think it'd be a good idea to have a copy of each agenda in each folder as well. Normally, I'd balk at that kind of redundancy, but these agenda's don't change much after the episodes change, and I'd like to ensure that these guides can mostly stand on their own.

Beyond that, I'm not sure how to structure these things. Let's just make them as useful as possible.
